     * this function returns the perpendicular distance from a point to the
     * line. This assumes all points are given as lists in the form [x, y].
     *
     * Note that, unlike most formulations of point-to-line-distance, the value
     * returned here isn't necessarily nonnegative. This is because Cytoscape.js
     * expects the control-point-distances used for unbundled-bezier edges to have
     * a sign based on which "side" of the line from source node to sink node
     * they're on:
     *
     *       negative
     * SOURCE ------> TARGET
     *       positive
     *
     * So here, if this edge has a bend "upwards," we'd give the corresponding
     * control point a negative distance from the line, and if the bend was
     * "downwards" it'd have a positive distance from the line. You can see this
     * for yourself here (http://js.cytoscape.org/demos/edge-types/) -- notice how
     * the control-point-distances for the unbundled-bezier (multiple) edge are
     * [40, -40] (a downward bend, then an upwards bend).
     *
     * What that means here is that we don't take the absolute value of the
     * numerator in this formula; instead, we negate it. This makes these distances
     * match up with what Cytoscape.js expects. (I'll be honest: I don't know why
     * this works. This is just what I found back in 2016. As a big heaping TODO,
     * I should really make this more consistent, or at least figure out *why* this
     * works -- it's worth noting that if you swap around linePoint1 and
     * linePoint2, this'll negate the distance you get, and I have no idea why this
     * is working right now.)
     *
     * Also note that, if distance(linePoint1, linePoint2) is equal to 0, this
     * will throw an Error (since this would make the point-to-line-distance
     * formula undefined, due to having 0 in the denominator). So don't define a
     * line by the same point twice!
     *
     * CODELINK: The formula used here is based on
     * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_line#Line_defined_by_two_points.
